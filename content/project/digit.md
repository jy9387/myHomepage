Detecting digits on the photographs of gas meters using a Convolutional Neural Network. The photos of a gas meter can be taken by a mini camera fixed in front of the meter and then delivered to our server. We plan to adopt the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to process these photos and read the digits on them automaticly. Finally people can obtain the digits of the gas meter by downloading the data from our server.

The codes for recognizing digits on the photos are shared at github [(code)](https://github.com/SHUCV/digit).
